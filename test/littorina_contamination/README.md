# Introduction
Ric suggested that the contigs with poor BLAST matches to *Aplysia californica* may be from *Litorina saxatilis*. I will therefore BLAST the contigs in chategory **?** from [this](https://github.com/mtop/Fucus_vesiculosus_genome_project/tree/master/test/blast_20150917_to_nr/unknown_contigs) analysis to a *Litorina saxatilis* assembly provided by Tomas. 

# Result
Only eight contigs had BLAST matches to the *Litorina saxatilis* assembly. The alignment length of these matches where only around 30 bp. Hence, our dataset does not seem to contain any Litorina sequences.

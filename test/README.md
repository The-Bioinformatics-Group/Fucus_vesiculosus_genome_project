### 20150915
Running first assembly (in test/20150915) on the new dataset A.Blomberg\_15\_01 to analyse the quality of the data. Using the filtered data delivered from SciLifeLab.

### 20150917
Testing a new assembly of the first F. vesiculosus dataset with the maximum word size (k-mer size) of 64 accepted by CLC.

### blast_F.vesiculosus_to_F.radicans
BLASTed the 100 longest sequences from the [F. vesiculosus assembly 20150915](https://github.com/mtop/Fucus_vesiculosus_genome_project/tree/master/test/20150915) to the [F. radicans assembly 20150915](https://github.com/mtop/Fucus_radicans_genome_project/tree/master/test/20150915) in order to estimate the genetic similarity between the two species.

### blast_20150917_to_nr
Blasting the assembly 20150917 to the NCBI nonredundant database using blastx, in order to examine the bacterial content of the sequences.

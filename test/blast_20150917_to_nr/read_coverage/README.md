# Introcuction
The analysis presented [here](https://github.com/mtop/Fucus_vesiculosus_genome_project/blob/master/test/blast_20150917_to_nr/README.md) analysed the new *Fucus Vesiculosus* dataset on the contig level. Here I'm translating the number of contigs to number of reads by analysing the read coverage of the 1002 longest contigs in the [20150917](https://github.com/mtop/Fucus_vesiculosus_genome_project/tree/master/test/20150917) assembly.

# Introduction
Blasting the first 5000 bp of the 1002 longest contigs from assembly 20150917 to the NCBI nonredundant database using blastx, in order to examine the bacterial content of the sequences.

# Result

The blast results have been divided into the following four categories:

* Fucus (27.9%): Best match to Ectocarpus siliculosus or Fucus vesiculosus
* Bact (0.8%): Good match(es) to any bacterial sequence
* ? (39.7%: Ambigous blast result. Often matches to many different types of organisms.
* No hits found (27.7%)

Note: Contigs in category "No hits found" are most likely of eukaryotic origin as the average bacterial gene length is 950 bp (ref.) and bacterial genes are ususally densly packed. Hence, I would expect that 5000 bp of a bacterial sequence would contain a coding region, and hence find a blast match.

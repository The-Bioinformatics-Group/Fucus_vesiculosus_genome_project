# Introduction
Testing a new assembly of the first F. vesiculosus dataset with the maximum word size (k-mer size) of 64 accepted by CLC. The [preqc graph](https://github.com/mtop/Fucus_vesiculosus_genome_project/blob/master/data/A.Blomberg_15_01/preqc/preqc_report.pdf) suggest that an even larger k-mer would result in longer contigs.

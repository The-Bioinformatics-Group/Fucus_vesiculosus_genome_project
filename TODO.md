# Planned analyses

* DONE - Lengt distribution of contigs
* Compare genetic diversity between F. vesiculosus and F. radicans by BLASTing the 100 longest contigs from one species to the other.
* DONE - Run another assembly using optimal k-mer size according to the preqc analysis. However, maximum k-mer/word size in CLC is 64 rather them something like 76, that preqc suggests for longest contigs.
* Estimate the bacterial content of the reads (Find bacterial contigs, mapp reads back to the contigs, count)
* The preqc report indicates that there is a lot of errors in the reads. Either filter/trim more or do error correction.
* Estimate coverage of the bacterial genomes.
* Run Kracken on the data.

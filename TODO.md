# Planned analyses

* DONE - Lengt distribution of contigs
* Compare genetic diversity between F. vesiculosus and F. radicans by BLASTing the 100 longest contigs from one species to the other.
* DONE - Run another assembly using optimal k-mer size according to the preqc analysis. However, maximum k-mer/word size in CLC is 64 rather them something like 76, that preqc suggests for longest contigs.

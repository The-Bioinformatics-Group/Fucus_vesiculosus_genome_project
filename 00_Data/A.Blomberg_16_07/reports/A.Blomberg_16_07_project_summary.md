# Methods

### Library construction
* Input: DNA
* Type: Illumina TruSeq Nano
* Option: 550bp
* Category: NeoPrep

### Sequencing
A) Clustering was done by 'onboard clustering' and samples were sequenced on HiSeq2500 (HiSeq Control Software 2.2.58/RTA 1.18.64) with a 2x301 setup using 'HiSeq Rapid SBS Kit v2' chemistry. The Bcl to FastQ conversion was performed using bcl2fastq_2.17 from the CASAVA software suite. The quality scale used is Sanger / phred33 / Illumina 1.8+.

### Data Flow
Raw sequencing data is demultiplexed and converted to FastQ on site before 
being transferred securely to [UPPMAX](http://www.uppmax.uu.se/) for delivery.

### Data Processing
To ensure that all sequenced data meets our guarantee of data quality and quantity,
a number of standardised bioinformatics quality control checks are performed before
delivery. These include checking the yield, sequence read quality and cross-sample contamination.

### Accredited workflow

# General Information

## Naming conventions

The data is delivered in FastQ format using Illumina 1.8 quality scores.
There will be one file for the forward reads and one file for the
reverse reads (if the run was a paired-end run).

The naming of the files follow the convention:

```
[NGI-NAME]_[BCL-CONVERSION-ID]_[LANE]_[READ]_[VOLUME].fastq.gz
```

* _NGI-NAME:_ Internal NGI sample indentifier
* _BCL-CONVERSION-ID:_ Indentifier set by bcl2fastq tool while demultiplexing
* _LANE:_ Sequencing lane that the file originates from
* _READ:_ Forward(1) or reverse(2) read indentifier
* _VOLUME:_ Volume index when file is large enough to be split into volumes

## Data access at UPPMAX

Data from the sequencing will be uploaded to the UPPNEX (UPPMAX Next
Generation sequence Cluster Storage, [uppmax.uu.se](http://www.uppmax.uu.se)),
from which the user can access it. You can find the data in the INBOX folder of the
UPPNEX project, which was created for you when your order was placed: 

```
/proj/b2011228/INBOX/A.Blomberg_16_07
```

If you have problems accessing your data, please contact NGI
[support@ngisweden.se](mailto:support@ngisweden.se).
